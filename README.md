# Discord-Selfbot-Template

DISCLAMER: Selfbotting is against Disord Terms of Service!

# Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/0xTetra/Discord-Selfbot-Template.git
cd Discord-Selfbot-Template
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Now that the files are on your system, and you've installed the dependencies; we can configure it.\
Configuration is very simple, the only thing you need to start this selfbot is your discord token.\
This can be found by following these steps:\
Open developer tools (F12)
Storage -> Local Storage -> CTRL + F5 to refresh -> Scroll to the bottom and copy the "token" value.
\
\
After obtaining your discord account token, edit the `config.json` file to use your token.\
When this is done, start the bot!
```
python3 bot.py
```
